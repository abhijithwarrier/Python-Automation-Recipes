# **🧩 Python Automation Recipes**

Welcome to **Python Automation Recipes** — a curated collection of practical Python automations built to solve **real-world workflow problems**.

This series focuses on automating everyday tasks developers actually face — file handling, scheduling, monitoring, reporting, and system utilities — using clear, reusable Python scripts.

Each recipe is designed to be **useful immediately**, not just educational.

Each script is:

- ⚙️ **Ready-to-run** — minimal setup, practical defaults
- 🧠 **Workflow-driven** — solves real automation problems
- ⏱️ **Time-saving** — reduces repetitive manual work
